// Write your explanation
/*
Event bubbling causes a click event to move from the element that was clicked
up through its parent elements. Since the button is inside the red div,
clicking the button also triggered the div's onClick event. Using
event.stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling up, so only the button's
click handler runs.
